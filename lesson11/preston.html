      <h3 class="article-title">A Message of Hope</h3>
      <h4 class="article-author">by Chris Fowler</h4>
      <p class="article-text">
        The following is a snippet of a Christmas message written by Chris Fowler in 2019:
        <br><br>
        "...With so many things that can cause us to despair and feel hopeless, is it hard to imagine that the Hope
        of Israel, the Hope of all mankind, came as a “babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger”?
        (Luke 2:12)
        <br><br>
        The Hope that there is a way back to God’s holy presence after committing sin and error. Even after
        continuing to struggle with the same sin or error time and time again. The Hope that there is
        redemption for a “soul so rebellious and proud as mine”. Don’t lose hope. Remember the newborn babe
        who has “graven thee upon the palms of [his] hands”, and became your advocate with the Father.
        (Hymn 193 I Stand All Amazed, Isaiah 49:16, 1 John 2:1)
        <br><br>
        The Hope that there is an end and a purpose to your suffering and your trials. When you wonder how it
        can get worse and why you deserve to go through such an affliction. When you wonder if there is an end
        to what may seem like a never-ending dark and lonely tunnel. There is light at the end! There is hope!
        Remember the newborn babe, even Jesus Christ, who went “forth, suffering pains and afflictions and
        temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him
        [your pains and sicknesses]… and he will take upon him [your] infirmities, that his bowels may be filled
        with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor [you]
        according to [your] infirmities”. (Alma 7:11-12)
        <br><br>
        As you reflect now on this wonderous event, remember what the angels declared then, and what the
        Holy Ghost declares now. Unto YOU is born a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. He was born for you. He
        lived for you. He died for you. He suffered and atoned for you. He was resurrected for you. He lives now
        for you, that you might have hope. Go as the shepherds, with haste, to find Him. (Luke 2:7-20)..."
